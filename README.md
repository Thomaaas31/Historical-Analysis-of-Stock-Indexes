# Historical-Analysis-of-Stock-Indexes
In this project I study historical performance of the S&P500 Index over the last 50 years and the last 12 months. The data is extracted directly from yahoo finance which makes it easy to update the graphs every day. A similar analysis can be done for different indexes or stocks just by changing the ticker in the json file.

## Requirements
Here are the versions of the librairies I used for this project.

* Python 3.7
* Pandas 1.0.3
* Numpy 1.18.2
* yfinance 0.1.54
* Matplotlib 2.2.2

## Results

Between 1970 and 2019, the Total Annual Return of the S&P 500 has been positive 39 years and negative 11 years. Negative peaks are often caused by global crises, as was the case in 1974 with the oil crisis or in 2008 with the financial crisis.
